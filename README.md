**Cosmoseed** is a lightweight seed node for Cosmos-based blockchains.  
Unlike traditional seed implementations, Cosmoseed actively filters out unreachable or failing peers, ensuring that only viable peers are served to clients.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Acts as a dedicated **Cosmos seed node**
- Maintains a strict and adaptive **address book** of peers
- Fully configurable via `config.yaml` or command-line flags
- Lightweight, single-binary deployment

---

## üì¶ Installation

To quickly install on linux or darwin you can run:

```bash
$ curl -s https://get.nibiru.fi/cosmoseed! | bash
```

Alternatively, you can download the binary from releases or use the available docker image.

---

## üõ† Configuration

By default, Cosmoseed reads its config from:

```bash
~/.cosmoseed/config.yaml
```

If it does not exist, Cosmoseed will create a new configuration file with the following defaults:

```yaml
nodeKeyPath: nodekey.json
addrBookPath: addrbook.json
addrBookStrict: true
listenAddr: tcp://0.0.0.0:26656
logLevel: info
maxInboundPeers: 2000
maxOutboundPeers: 20
maxPacketMsgPayloadSize: 1024
chainID: ""
seeds: ""
```

Please note that `chainID` and `seeds` are required fields. You can either include them in the config file or pass them as command-line flags.

Once Cosmoseed starts and grabs the first peers, the address book will contain peers and `seeds` can then be omitted on following application starts.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Command-Line Flags

```bash
$ cosmoseed --help

Usage of cosmoseed:
  -chain-id string
    	Chain ID to use
  -home string
    	Path to config/data directory (default "~/.cosmoseed")
  -log-level string
    	Logging level (default "info")
  -seeds string
    	Comma-separated list of seed peers
  -show-node-id
    	Print node ID and exit
  -version
    	Print version and exit
```

Flags take precedence over values defined in `config.yaml`.

---

## üß™ Example Usage

```bash
$ cosmoseed \
  -chain-id nibiru-testnet-2 \
  -seeds c2f87136e1a8b1c4469ff5a65b6cb3d6aca2b5fd@34.79.42.220:26656
```
